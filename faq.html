            Power outlets on Taniti are 120 volts, just like in the United States, making it convenient for most U.S. travelers. 
            The drinking age is 18, though it is not strictly enforced, and alcohol sales are prohibited between midnight and 9:00 a.m. 
            Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, but rural areas—particularly among older residents—may have limited English speakers.
        </p>

            Taniti is a safe destination, with violent crime being very rare. However, as tourism grows, incidents of petty crimes, 
            such as pickpocketing, are on the rise. Visitors can rest assured as there is one hospital staffed with multilingual employees, 
            along with several clinics available across the island.
        </p>
        <p>
            The island uses U.S. dollars as its currency but widely accepts euros and yen. Currency exchange is facilitated by banks, 
            and most businesses accept major credit cards. Visitors should note that national holidays often result in closures of tourist 
            attractions and restaurants, so planning around holidays is recommended.
